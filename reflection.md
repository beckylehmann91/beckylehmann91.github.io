- What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?

The challenge helped me to understand when I should manipulate the padding, border or margin of an element in order to get a desired effect. More specifically, I found it was best to increase or decrease the margin of an element if I wanted to alter its general position on the page, either in relation to the limits of the page or to other elements.
I would edit the border if I wanted to create a particular effect (ex. solid, dashed, change color, etc.) or expand the outline of an element. Finally, if I wanted to change the amount of space between the content and border of an element, I would alter the padding.

- What did you learn about CSS positioning?

It's harder than it looks! I found I could often achieve a similar effect by manipulating the code in entirely disparate ways. However, a key take-away for me was to adhere to "best practices" rather than just finding a solution to "make it work." Positioning takes persistence and patience. For this reason, I am excited to continue to work with others using CSS. I think we will all benefit from understanding the various solutions available to us, and how we can continue to improve our own code.

- What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?

I found the stylistic qualities of the elements to be the easiest to implement. Editing the style of the font, background and border is pretty straight-forward. The most difficult part was positioning the elements on the page. Figuring out how to implement changes to margin, float and positioning in an effective way often proved challenging. There were moments when my page looked all right, then I would change one aspect of the design and all the elements would shift.

- What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?

I learned a lot about the interplay between HTML and CSS, how to define classes, pseudo-classes and IDs then use those denotations to style the code in CSS. I also learned how important it is to think of the site holistically, rather than just a given page. Often times, programmers will build off one CSS file for multiple HTML files in order to create a consistent look and feel. This certainly challenged my previous way of thinking, which was limited to creating one web page and adding styling for just that page.
