        When working on a project, how should you handle the plethoric mass of file versions that are bound to result?
        Before I get into the meat and potatoes of this post, let's take a journey back in time.
    </p>
    <p>
         In the past, you may have found yourself saving ten different versions of the same file, using slightly altered file names to track changes. Your folders probably filled up pretty quickly and you may have suffered a headache or two. It seems like a pretty clunky way to organize changes, doesn't it? If you've done this, don't worry! You're not alone (you should see my Documents folder from high school). Which brings me to the focus of this post: version control. Perhaps you've heard buzz about it in the coding world, but what exactly is it? To put it simply, version control is a way of tracking changes you make to a file. However, unlike the clunky file-naming that you may have used in the past, it provides "snapshots" of historical versions through "commits," which are basically collections of changes. Version control allows you to view the state of a file or project at different points in time while allowing you to contain your work to a repository. It also enables you to more effectively collaborate with others. Let's explore version control a little further by discussing two significant software programs: git and GitHub.
    </p>
    <p>
        So what exactly is git? Git is a type of version control software you can use to make and commit changes to a local repository. That is, you can edit files on your own computer and create multiple versions of your work. Say you want to make changes to a text file. You edit the file, then add and commit the changes in git. The commit serves as a "snapshot" of the new version of the text file. By looking at the git log, you can see any other commits that have been made, including a unique ID for each commit.
        In addition, each entry will have a commit message, explaining the purpose of the change. That way, if you realize, "Shoot, I actually like the version of this file that I made a few days ago!" you can use information from the log to revert to the previous version. Phew!
    </p>
    <p>
        GitHub, on the other hand, serves as a remote repository (located on the Internet) that allows multiple users to collaborate and share projects in the same space. That means if you're working with a friend on a project, each of you can push information to GitHub and merge your changes. I should mention, both git and GitHub have branching capabilities, which help to further accommodate various versions of a project. The master branch represents the "cleanest" version of the project. By creating additional "feature" branches, you can edit files without affecting the master branch. This becomes especially helpful in group work. When you're working on the project with your friend, each of you can push branches to GitHub and review changes before impacting the master branch.
    </p>
    <p>
        So what's the moral of the story? Version control is great because it can help you track changes you make to a file or project. Through software like git and GitHub, you can manage changes through "commits" and more effectively collaborate with others. So stop with endless file-naming and "git" on the version control train!
