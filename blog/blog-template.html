- How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?

I enjoyed working with a pair on this challenge. We ended up creating our own wireframes and HTML, but kept communication open throughout the challenge. It was nice to share what each of us was working on, while sharing ideas for how to break up sections of the HTML.

- Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?

I do find wireframing to be helpful to my development process, as it allows me to understand how to break up the HTML code. By drawing a rough sketch of the different aspects of the page (nav bar, blog title, images, etc.), I provide myself with a guide to reference as I write out the code.

- What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?

Although we each created our own wireframes, they were pretty similar in that each included the blog title, subtitle, date, images and text. We agreed those main elements should be included, but still maintained a simple layout, which seemed to be an effective approach.

- What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any) ?

I learned about <article>, which applies perfectly to blog posts (also things like online news articles). I also experimented with using <aside> to reference my blog list page (a section of the page that isn't essential to understanding the content of the page, but is related).
